1)Description

The "Pizza Management System" has been developed to overcome the  problems prevailing in the manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the establishment to carry out operations in a smooth and  effective manner.

The software is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while  entering the data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use  this system. Thus it proves that it is a user-friendly Pizza Management  System, as described above, and can lead to error free, secure, reliable  and fast management system. Thus it will help the organization in  better utilization of resources.

2)Scope of Proposed System

This system helps customers to place orders online and also eases the workload on the staff of pizza shop. This system will make things easier for staff as whole ordering process is done by customer only.
It would be much more comfortable for the customers to have an online pizza order. It would be hassle free for users as they can select the pizza they want and make payment for it. Also it will reduce the purchasing time for customers.
This system will provide customer all the details of his order before making order. This confirmation will help customers to check the items ordered with their prices.

3)Technology Used

  a]Python:

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.

  b]SQLite:

SQLite is an embedded, server-less relational database management system. It is an in-memory open-source library with zero configuration and does not require any installation. Also, it is very convenient as it’s less than 500kb in size, which is significantly lesser than other database management systems.

SQLite is one of the most popular and easy-to-use relational database systems. It possesses many features over other relational databases. Many big MNCs such as Adobe, use SQLite as the application file format for their Photoshop Lightroom product. Airbus, a European multinational aerospace corporation, uses SQLite in the flight software for the A350 XWB family of aircraft. 

4)Software and Hardware Requirements:
